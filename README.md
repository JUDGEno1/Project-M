Project-M
=========

Based off of CyanogenMod.

Community MUST contribute. Now !
I'll start 1st. MBQsniper doesn't count as he's a robot.

This is not a project. This is THE Project-M.

We'll start with CyanogenMod base and add features, as requested by other members.
The only official way to make requests is by entering it on "Requests" file on Project-M github repository.
MBQsniper will have the final word on approving requests. He might open up a poll for tight calls.

Again, feel free to edit this file with more useful information.
