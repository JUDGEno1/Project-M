  > Do what msa1390 asked above. :)
  > Add a screenshot option in the nav bar, if there are couple more people ask for it.
  > I found that I see the error message, that I reported on xda thread, everytime I reboot the phone and connect to internet. See if this helps.
  > Show available RAM in recents window. If possible, show it on statusbar. That would be even awesomer.

Request by gmorel4
1. Add the ability to change the dpi of the system. The rom is awesome, love the performance and various tweaks. This change, in my mind, would make the rom amazing.
